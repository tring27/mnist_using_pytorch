MNIST digit recognizer Neural Net using Pytorch.

# Details

Although Pytorch contains MNIST dataset, but I wanted to write my own custom Dataset and hence loaded the MNIST dataset from Kaggle into Pytorch using `Dataset` class.

# Version 1 (v1) MNIST digit recognizer using 3 Fully connected layers in Pytorch and LogSoftmax as the final layer

Here I tried to build MNIST digit recognizer with a simple 3-fully-connected layer neural network written using Pytorch. Reached **91%** accuracy.

# Version 2 (v2) MNIST digit recognizer uses 2 Convolution layers, a dropout layer, and 2 Fully connected layers in Pytorch and LogSoftmax as the final layer

Here I tried to participate in Kaggle's MNIST challenge, my network is not quite as accurate compared to others on leaderboard, but I managed to get about **94%** accuracy and a decent place on leaderboard.
